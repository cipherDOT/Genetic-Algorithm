Genetic Algorithm in python 3.8

<h3>Overview:</h3>
# The Genetic Algorithm

# Implementing genetic algorithm on a population of a given
# size to attain the goal of reaching a given target.

# AIM:
# I will be using the word "genome" to indicate
# the creatures in the genetic evolution algorithm

# GENETIC ALGORITHM
# [step 1] A population, on it's first generation is left to roam randomly inside the canvas.
#
# [step 2] The next generation is bred from the best performers, selected based on a fitness function of the first generation in hopes to
#          recreate the genes that made the genomes to go in the desired direction.
#
# [step 3] Some genes of the next generation is mutated[randomly changed] based on a MUTATION RATE, this, in theory, will bring
#          some variance in the behaviors of the genomes to better replicate natural evolution.
#
# [step 4] The above steps are followed for many generation untill the genomes are almost perfectly skilled to reach the given target
#          due to generations of evolution and mutation.
